  <p><b>Well now it works...
    Some usfule pointers:
    1) GitHub Host servers info: https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/
    2) sub menu on "NameCheep" was bit rearanged and very broken (banners aren't desplaying text and not very user friendly. I state that as some one hwo has used html and made web pages since 6th grade).
